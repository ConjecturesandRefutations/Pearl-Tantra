        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>Emanating as Pearl Tantra, a non-dual shamanic tantrik yoga practice born in Cape Town. Tantra loosely refers to the transmutation of sexual or dense frequency energy into Divine Energy.
          Our direct reference point is the body, where much is held, revealed, released and integrated. The bulk and initial groundwork is made up of embodiment practices – 
          breathwork, massage, touch and movement drawing from a range of deeply lived methods like yoga asanas and pranayama, voicing, fascia release, trauma releasing exercises…

        <p>Sessions typically consist of the powerful combo of consult inquiry and embodiment. The practice is for individuals as well as couples or small groups. 
          <br><br>
         Online sessions are a worthwhile exploration in and of themselves and now is the perfect time. As with all things working online has some limitations, however most parts of the practice can be included and it is proving a valuable container for creativity, mirroring and consolidating connection with oneself. I am enlivened by the opportunity for new emerging creations and in establishing solid foundations toward potential practise in person.</p>
          <p>For sincere practitioners who are called and ready, I facilitate next level energetic activation and initiation.

          <h6>Insight into the roots of our exploration… </h6>
          <h7>What Is Who Is?? </h7>
        <p>An embodied journey toward surrendered Presence, through which life force can flow and we are truly breathed moved and expressed 
          perhaps even into orgasmicness for Life itself.</p>
          <h7>Heart Light Sound</h7>
          <p>Heart activation and healing takes place through working with light and sound energy frequencies (sound is light in the form 
            of motion, a way to move light). Meditating on the receiving and giving loop of sustainable energy, to a final resting into the abyss of silence and the stillness of nothingness.</p>
                      <h7>Ceremony</h7>
            <p>In slowing down, we bring consciousness and reverence into as many moments as we can. In this opening to Life there is the gift of the channel for communion and prayer, through 
              which we can also integrate Oneness down into daily life as ceremony. Ordinary takes on new depth of meaning and sparkle of essence.</p>

                 <p>The ongoing integration of this practice is based upon contemplation, the sweet spot to be discovered between concentration (effort) and meditation (no effort). 
                     Those drawn to Pearl Tantra are willing to be guided through intuitive processes and are open to the flow of the feminine way. Having a clearly defined container allows relaxation into the true receptivity, sensitivity, beauty, chaos, creativity, nourishment, vulnerability and strength of The Deep Feminine Itself, which in turn gives rise to The Divine Masculine, within the individual and therefore greater collective. Pearl Tantra is birthed of my experience.

                <p>You are invited to trust, take a pause with me, and enter the stream into the wildness of your ecstatic heart. </p>
                <p>And so, just as many pathways that lead here continue from here as One. </p>
