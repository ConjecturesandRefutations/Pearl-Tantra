The ongoing integration of this practice is based upon contemplation, the sweet spot to be discovered between concentration (effort) and meditation (no effort).
<br/><br/>
Those drawn to Pearl Tantra are willing to be guided through intuitive processes and are open to the flow of the feminine way. Having a clearly defined container allows relaxation into the true receptivity, sensitivity, beauty, chaos, creativity, nourishment, vulnerability and strength of The Deep Feminine Itself, which in turn gives rise to The Divine Masculine, within the individual and therefore greater collective. Pearl Tantra is birthed of my experience. In putting all questions, ideas and expectations aside, the offering is for pure receiving through direct experience.
<br/><br/>
You are invited to trust, take a pause with me, and enter the stream into the wildness of your ecstatic heart.
<br/><br/>
And so, just as many pathways that lead here continue from here as One.
