        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Emanating as Pearl Tantra, a non-dual shamanic tantrik yoga practice born in Cape Town. Tantra loosely refers to the transmutation of sexual or dense frequency energy into Divine Energy.
          Our direct reference point is the body, where much is held, revealed, released and integrated. The bulk and initial groundwork is made up of embodiment practices – 
          breathwork, massage, touch and movement drawing from a range of deeply lived methods like yoga asanas and pranayama, voicing, fascia release, trauma releasing exercises…

      <div class="col s12 l6 pull-l5 right-align offset-l1">
        <p>Sessions typically consist of the powerful combo of consult inquiry and embodiment. Initially guided by myself – 
          tantrika and founder of Pearl Tantra, Mana Muse – the practice is for individuals as well as couples.
          <br><br>
         In-person sessions are dependent on my location and discretion.</p>
         <p>Online sessions are a worthwhile exploration in and of themselves and now is the perfect time. 
          As with all things working online has some limitations, however most parts of the practice can be 
          included and it is proving a valuable container for creativity, mirroring and consolidating connection with oneself. 
          I am enlivened by the opportunity for new emerging creations and in establishing solid foundations toward potential practise in person.</p>
          <p>For sincere practitioners who are called and ready, I facilitate next level energetic activation and initiation.

        <p>An embodied journey toward surrendered Presence, through which life force can flow and we are truly breathed moved and expressed 
          perhaps even into orgasmicness for Life itself.</p>
          <p>Heart activation and healing takes place through working with light and sound energy frequencies (sound is light in the form 
            of motion, a way to move light). Meditating on the receiving and giving loop of sustainable energy, to a final resting into the abyss of silence and the stillness of nothingness.</p>
            <p>In slowing down, we bring consciousness and reverence into as many moments as we can. In this opening to Life there is the gift of the channel for communion and prayer, through 
              which we can also integrate Oneness down into daily life as ceremony. Ordinary takes on new depth of meaning and sparkle of essence.</p>

        <p>Those drawn to Pearl Tantra are willing to be guided through intuitive processes and are open to the flow of the feminine way. Having a clearly defined container allows relaxation into the true receptivity, sensitivity, beauty, chaos, creativity, nourishment, vulnerability and strength of The Deep Feminine Itself, which in turn gives rise to The Divine Masculine, within the individual and therefore greater collective. Pearl Tantra is birthed of my experience. In putting all questions, ideas and expectations aside, the offering is for pure receiving through direct experience.

          <span class="card-title">Authentic Tantric Shamanism Online</span>
          <p>I did several online sessions with Mana with the intention to deeply inquire and shed some light on something that has been sitting with me for a long time. 
            By expressing herself in full authenticity and with her wholeness of body mind and soul, I felt very safe in her presence, totally heard and seen. ALL of me welcomed whilst led by her spiritual, empathic and grounded way that carries such wisdom and deep inner knowing. Mana held space for me, listened when it was needed and encouraged me to speak my truth – or pause – when it was needed. She has this rare and very beautiful sensibility to feel into things and… yes… into me and what stirred in me, always channeling resonant words reflective of the moment. There was no perceived push only loving guidance to tap into the depths of inner knowing within me. Generally I have been somewhat hesitant around online sessions assuming obstacles to their benefit, however I was amazed by the strong connection and energetic transmission I felt in our meetings online. A creative soul lives in Mana and she has a wide range of ways, some of which can seem unusually challenging at first yet always integrous and most refreshing in truth. THANK YOU Mana. 
            I love and honour the important work you are doing.</p>

          <span class="card-title">A Year Of Muse</span>
          
          
          <p>It was 2 years ago I met Mana Muse. An intense year of initiation into the depths of truth, love and death followed. 
            While the story of our work together is a tale of many wonders, the change in me is perhaps more useful to share here. My relationship with myself has changed, self reflected in me, world and women. Guided by the Muse I have settled into a deep surrender to life in all her moods. During the year I sailed and worked under the ocean in the frozen lands of Antarctica, lost a best friend to a car crash, lost my father to heart disease, built a house out of mud, held my mother through deep mental disturbance and loved, lost and loved again. I feel like I have become an adult, finally at 34. I have become a man too perhaps, not by force or discipline but by deep surrender to my feminine. An unraveling of layers of personal and collective trauma holding me back from authentic expression of my authentic masculine core. I relate to women differently, cleansed of many deep programs of scarcity and control. The Muse had teachings, techniques and transmissions, at times she wowed me with her wisdom and at times enraged me with her very being. Through it all she held me in presence and love and that is where the healing happened. 
            I remain ever grateful for the gift that she shares for the liberation of all beings.</p>

          <p>So grateful to have met these loving and warm women. Present in our shared moments, filled with love,
            intimate and warm. This experience was definitely one of the best if not the best intimate experience
            I have ever had. Taking me through a journey of bliss and joy, peaceful and safe, true and contained.
            It opened my heart and made me feel the rhythm of this gentle breath and touch several days after.
            Using their voices in the session, with the combination of their presence and touch, creates an
            unearthly being, taking you to another dimension and then back again safe and weightless,
            filled with gratitude and love.</p>
